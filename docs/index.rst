Welcome to PyDANJA
==================

Welcome to PyDANJA's documentation.

PyDANJA aims to provide a simple way to integrate JSON:API input and output to
your PyDantic/FastAPI based projects.

It does this by providing generic PyDantic based containers which can be used to annotate
the output and input of functions.

This documentation is current Work In Progress. Please see the examples provided in this project.
